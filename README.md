# Thermodynamics
 Repository for the development of general thermodynamic code

This repository is intended to host various thermodynamic routines.   Primarily it hosts aes_thermo.py which stands for Atmosphere in the Earth System Thermodynamics, AES being the name of my department at the MPI-M in Hamburg, DE.  aes_thermo.py is my python library of thermodynamic functions.  These are routines I find useful in my work and which strives to provide accurate and consistent descriptions of thermodynamic relations with the option of additional much simpler, and computationally more efficient, approximations.
